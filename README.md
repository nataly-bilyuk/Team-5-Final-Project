# Team-5-Final-Project
# Project Description #

Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian eCommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store has been provided to your company for analysis.

Your manager is asking you to analyse the provided dataset using your data analytics skills, prepare a PowerBI dashboard with visualisations that answer key questions, as well as prepare and present a final report.


## **Project proposal** ## 


The team decided to focus on the following areas:

### **Overall view of marketplace revenue & volume** ###

Total GMV, number of orders, average order value, revenue per month 

GMV, CAC, churn, revenue per seller/customer 

 
### **Customer behaviours through payments and cancellations** ### 

Payment Method Analysis e.g. Customer preference and payment behaviour. Payment method usage, average payment value by method 

Analyse Order Cancellation & Return Rates by reviewing Cancel/return rates by seller/product/category and customer, potentially looking into payment patterns, extremely high/low order values or cancellation rates 

### **Customer Behaviour and Demand** ###

Customer satisfaction: average review scores compared with customer spending, volume of orders, product category, geographic distribution, seller (identify high quality sellers); review scores over time 

Where buyers/sellers are located and how location affects sales: bubble map showing seller/buyer distribution with different bubble sizes (avg. spend, avg. review score) 

Stretch: sentiment analysis of customer reviews over time and spot trends in complaints e.g., “overpriced”, “poor quality”. 

 ### **Seller performance** ###

Identify high and low performing sellers analysing seller revenue, number of orders and order fulfilment time; 

Analyse delivery and logistics efficiency by studying the delivery time distribution and shipping latency 

 ### **Product/Product category analysis:** ### 

Comprehensive product analysis by evaluating best-selling categories, top-revenue product categories, revenue and volume trends over time
